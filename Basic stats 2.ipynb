    "### Background\n",
    "In quality control processes, especially when dealing with high-value items, destructive sampling is a necessary but costly method to ensure product quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The test to determine whether an item meets the quality standards destroys the item, leading to the requirement of small sample sizes due to cost constraints.\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "A manufacturer of print-heads for personal computers is interested in estimating the mean durability of their print-heads in terms of the number of characters printed before failure. To assess this, the manufacturer conducts a study on a small sample of print-heads due to the destructive nature of the testing process.\n",
    "Data\n",
    "A total of 15 print-heads were randomly selected and tested until failure. The durability of each print-head (in millions of characters) was recorded as follows:\n",
    "1.13, 1.55, 1.43, 0.92, 1.25, 1.36, 1.32, 0.85, 1.07, 1.48, 1.20, 1.33, 1.18, 1.22, 1.29\n",
    "#### Assignment Tasks\n",
    "- Build 99% Confidence Interval Using Sample Standard Deviation\n",
    "Assuming the sample is representative of the population, construct a 99% confidence interval for the mean number of characters printed before the print-head fails using the sample standard deviation. Explain the steps you take and the rationale behind using the t-distribution for this task.\n",
    "- Build 99% Confidence Interval Using Known Population Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "If it were known that the population standard deviation is 0.2 million characters, construct a 99% confidence interval for the mean number of characters printed before failure.\n"
